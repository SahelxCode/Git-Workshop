\# Which Anime Character Are You?



\## Project Description



This is a fun, interactive web project that lets users find out which anime character they are! Users can pick a number from 1 to 5, and the page will display the corresponding character's name and image.  



This project demonstrates the following concepts learned in the Git/GitHub workshop:  



\- Creating a Git repository and making commits  

\- Using feature branches and pull requests  

\- Resolving merge conflicts  

\- Setting up a GitHub Actions workflow  

\- Adding project files (HTML, CSS, JS, images)  

\- Hosting interactive content  



The project is minimal but fully functional, perfect for demonstrating Git workflow skills and simple web interactivity.
